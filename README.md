## LISTED ARE ONLY TOOLS THAT INTERFACE WITH OR ARE CODED IN C++ AS THAT IS MY USE CASE

[Cocos2D](https://www.cocos.com/en/cocos2d-x) - an engine built for 2D mobile games (but it can be used for mac/windows dev as well) that allows cross platform support out of the box. It can be used in C++, JavaScript, or Lua. <br>
[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) - a library (/API?) that allows developers to interface with all the I/O and hardware in the computer. It uses only 2D graphics. It is written in C++ and is object oriented. <br>
[SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) - a library (/API?) that allows low level access to the computers I/O and hardware. SDL can do 2D and 3D graphics. *SDL is very similar to SFML, however it is not object oriented. <br>
[Github](https://github.com/) - Github is a file hosting website that allows teams to work on coding projects together more efficiently. <br>
[PhysX](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX) - a physics simulation SDK. <br>
