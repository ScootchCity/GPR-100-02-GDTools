LISTED ARE ONLY TOOLS THAT INTERFACE WITH OR ARE CODED IN C++ AS THAT IS MY USE CASE

SFML - a library (/API?) that allows developers to interface with all the I/O and hardware in the computer. It uses only 2D graphics. It is written in C++ and is object oriented.
SDL - a library (/API?) that allows low level access to the computers I/O and hardware. SDL can do 2D and 3D graphics. *SDL is very similar to SFML, however it is not object oriented
